# MachineLearningModels
Machine Learning models created on datasets available on kaggle and over internet.
Linear Regression Model:

Dataset: Titanic, Hotel Cancellation, Elantra, Customer Churn Analysis, Iris
Description: Built a linear regression model to establish a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables in the datasets. Leveraged the ordinary least squares method to estimate the coefficients and predict continuous target variables.
Logistic Regression Model:
Dataset: Titanic, Hotel Cancellation, Elantra, Customer Churn Analysis, Iris
Description: Employed logistic regression to model the probability of binary outcomes in the datasets. Used maximum likelihood estimation to determine the optimal parameters and predict the likelihood of events such as survival, cancellation, or churn based on relevant predictors.
Decision Tree Model:
Dataset: Titanic, Hotel Cancellation, Elantra, Customer Churn Analysis, Iris
Description: Constructed decision tree models to make predictions by recursively splitting the datasets based on different features. Captured non-linear relationships and interactions between variables, enabling accurate classification or regression tasks.
Random Forest Model:
Dataset: Titanic, Hotel Cancellation, Elantra, Customer Churn Analysis, Iris
Description: Employed ensemble learning techniques to build random forest models. Combined multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting, resulting in robust and reliable models for classification and regression problems.
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):
Dataset: Titanic, Hotel Cancellation, Elantra, Customer Churn Analysis, Iris
Description: Applied SMOTE to address class imbalance in datasets where minority classes are underrepresented. Generated synthetic samples to increase the representation of minority classes, enhancing the performance of classification models and reducing bias.
GradientSearchCV:
Dataset: Titanic, Hotel Cancellation, Elantra, Customer Churn Analysis, Iris
Description: Utilized the GradientSearchCV algorithm for hyperparameter tuning. Performed an exhaustive search over specified parameter values to find the optimal combination that maximizes model performance, ensuring accurate predictions and improved generalization.
RandomizedGradientSearchCV:
Dataset: Titanic, Hotel Cancellation, Elantra, Customer Churn Analysis, Iris
Description: Employed the RandomizedGradientSearchCV algorithm for efficient hyperparameter tuning. Conducted a randomized search over a specified parameter distribution to identify the best parameter configuration, optimizing model performance while reducing computational costs.
These models and techniques were applied to various datasets, including Titanic, Hotel Cancellation, Elantra, Customer Churn Analysis, and Iris, to address specific analytical objectives and derive meaningful insights from the data.
